                <p>The <strong>Advanced Learning and Research Institute</strong> (<strong>ALaRI</strong>) was
                    established in 1999 at the <a target=_blank
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Università_della_Svizzera_italiana">Università della
                        Svizzera italiana</a> (USI) in <a target=_blank href="https://www.lugano.ch/"> Lugano</a>,
                    to promote research and education in embedded systems and, later, it was incorporated into the <a
                        target=_blank href="https://www.inf.usi.ch/en">Faculty of Informatics</a> of the same
                    university. After almost 20 years of research and premier education in embedded systems, ALaRI has
                    merged with the <a target=_blank href="https://www.idsia.usi-supsi.ch/"> Dalle Molle Institute
                        for Artificial Intelligence</a> (<a target=_blank

                        Artificiale, IDSIA</a>) and was transformed into <a href="https://gmlg.ch/"> Graph
                        Machine Learning Group</a> (GMLG) concentrating mainly on research on topics
                    such as graph machine learning, non-stationary environments, spatiotemporal data,
                    reinforcement learning and dynamical systems.</p>

                <h2>Brief History</h2>
                <p>ALaRI was founded to fill up a research and educational gap in embedded systems (today better known
                    as cyber-physical
                    systems or Internet of Things) by ex-Rector of Politecnico di Milano, Prof. <a target=_blank
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Dadda">Luigi Dadda</a>, Prof. <a target=_blank
                        href="https://www.deib.polimi.it/ita/personale/details/59838"> Mariagiovanna Sami</a>
                    (Politecnico di
                    Milano) and Prof. <a target=_blank href="https://si2.epfl.ch/demichel/"> Giovani de Micheli</a>
                    (Stanford University, currently EPFL-Lausanne) with enthusiastic support of industry, especially ST
                    Microelectronics and Hewlett-Packard who became major supporters of the Institute. Also, companies
                    such as
                    Bosch, csem and imec, among others, provided support in the form of internships for ALaRI students.
                    The main
                    source of funding to support ALaRI’s research and infrastructure came from industry, Swiss National
                    Foundation, European Union, and the university.</p>
                <p>The directors of the Institute include Prof. <a target=_blank
                        href="https://www.deib.polimi.it/ita/personale/details/59838"> Mariagiovanna Sami</a>
                    (1999-2012,
                    part time from the Politecnico di Milano), Prof. <a target=_blank href="http://usi.to/iyy"> Miroslaw
                        Malek</a> (2012-2017, full time from the Humboldt University in Berlin) and then from 2018 Prof.
                    <a target=_blank href="http://usi.to/prz"> Cesare Alippi</a>, who is now in charge of the new
                    incarnation
                    of ALaRI, the Graph Machine Learning Group.
