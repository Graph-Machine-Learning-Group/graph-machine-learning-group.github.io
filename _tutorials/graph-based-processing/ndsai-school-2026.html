                    Successful applications of <strong>deep learning</strong> in <strong>time series</strong> processing
                    often involve training a single neural network on a collection of (related) time series.
                    Pairwise relationships among time series can be modeled by considering a (possibly dynamic) graph
                    spanning the collection. In this context, <strong>graph-based
                        methods</strong> take the standard deep learning approach to time series processing a step
                    forward.
                    The recent theoretical and practical developments in graph machine learning make adopting such an
                    approach particularly appealing and timely.

                    The twofold <strong>objective</strong> of this tutorial is to:
                <ol>
                    <li>offer a <strong>comprehensive overview</strong> of the field, with a focus on forecasting
                        applications;
                    </li>
                    <li>provide <strong>tools and guidelines</strong> to design and evaluate graph-based models for time
                        series.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                This tutorial is meant for early-career researchers and practitioners who wish to apply graph deep
                learning methods to their time series processing applications.
                At the same time, the tutorial provides experienced scholars with a coherent framing of the state of the art and new perspectives.
